# xsct-cake

Interface for `xsct` written in POSIX compliant shell-script. \
Intended to be used as a simple and minimal alternative to other blue light filters / night modes. \
Designed with polybar integration in mind. \
\
Two files are created in `~/.cache/`
- `xsct.tempk` - Stores the current `xsct` Kelvin value
- `xsct.state` - Stores the ON/OFF state

## Dependencies

- Any POSIX compliant shell, such as `dash` 
- xsct - https://github.com/faf0/sct/
- inotifywait (for `xsct-cake tail`) - https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools (privided by package `inotify-tools` on most distros)

## Installation

Just `git clone` this repo and move the file `xsct-cake` to any location of your choice. \
For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/edermats32/xsct-cake.git && \
cp ./xsct-cake/xsct-cake ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake
```
You may also need to make it executable: 
```sh
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake
```

## Usage

The `xsct-cake` parameters do not start with a `-` in order to distinguish them from the `xsct` ones. \
Only one parameter can be used at a time (only the first parameter is read).

| Command                       | Explanation                                                                                               |
| :-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `xsct-cake init`              | Only creates the files `xsct.tempk` `and xsct.state` in `~/.cache` (all other commands will also do this) |
| `xsct-cake print`             | Prints the current value in `~/.cache/xsct.tempk` if `~/.cache/xsct.state` is *ON* else it prints "OFF"   |
| `xsct-cake tail`              | Same as `xsct-cake print` but will continuously print on every value and state change                     |
| `xsct-cake restore`           | Sets `xsct` to the value stored in `~/.cache/xsct.tempk`                                                  |
| `xsct-cake toggle`            | Turns the state ON/OFF (not the same as `xsct --toggle`)                                                  |
| ____________________          |                                                                                                           |

All `xsct` can of course also be used. See https://github.com/faf0/sct/

## Example
*Assuming `xsct-cake` is in `~/.local/bin/xsct-cake`*

### Polybar
`~/.config/polybar/config.ini`
```sh
[module/xsct]
type = custom/script
exec = ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake tail # Look for value and state changes

tail = true # Don't worry, this will not blow up your CPU (hopefully)

click-left = ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake toggle      # Turn ON/OFF
scroll-up = ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake -d 300 1     # Increase by 300K
scroll-down = ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake -d -300 1  # Decrease by 300K

label = "XSCT %output%"
# If you have a nerdfont, below is a good glyph [f0594]:
# label = "ó°–” %output%"

```

### bspwm
`~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc`
```sh
~/.local/bin/xsct-cake restore & # Restores the previous temperature
```

### sxhkd
`~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc`
```sh
super + XF86AudioRaiseVolume
        ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake -d 300 1    # Increase by 300K

super + XF86AudioLowerVolume
        ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake -d -300 1   # Decrease by 300K

super + XF86AudioMute
        ~/.local/bin/xsct-cake toggle      # Turn ON/OFF
```
